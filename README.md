## Steam Discoverer

A tool to discover Steam clients on your network and find out what they are playing. 

### Features

* Discovers steam clients on your LAN using the In Home Streaming discovery protocol
* Looks up Steam API to see what they're playing
* Stores data in DB (currently redis) for later analysis

### Roadmap

* Make library to abstract this listening - expose just "we saw a client, here's details!"
* Add web dashboard to get real time visualisation of the state of your LAN
* Add configuration options, eg, immediately anonymise data (don't record steam ID), Steam API polling interval, 
* Record ALLLLL the data (not just a brief summary of it)
* Broadcast on multiple interfaces/subnets (eg, in case you have a multi-VLAN environment)
